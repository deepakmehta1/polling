# Polling Strategies Example in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates two fundamental polling strategies—**Short Polling** and **Long Polling**—using Python. Polling is a technique used by clients to communicate with servers to check for updates or data changes. Understanding these strategies is essential for building efficient client-server applications, such as chat systems, live feeds, or notification services.

### **Short Polling**

- **Definition:** The client periodically sends requests to the server at fixed intervals to check for new data.
- **Pros:** Simple to implement.
- **Cons:** Can lead to unnecessary requests when there's no new data, resulting in higher latency and increased server load.

### **Long Polling**

- **Definition:** The client sends a request to the server, and the server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
- **Pros:** Reduces unnecessary requests, lower latency in receiving updates.
- **Cons:** More complex to implement, requires the server to handle many open connections.

This project includes a Flask server that handles both polling strategies and two separate client scripts to interact with the server using short and long polling.
